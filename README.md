# 🚇 Metro-System-PhnomPenh

This is an imaginary project that I hope to bring to life one day.

After visiting cities like Bangkok, New York, and Atlanta—where metro systems saved me a lot of time and money as a broke college student—I was inspired to imagine a similar system for Phnom Penh.

Even though Phnom Penh doesn’t have a metro system yet, I love the city deeply and wanted to apply what I’ve learned in software development to build something visionary. This project combines my passion for urban transportation and backend development, and I hope it can one day help shape a better-connected future for Cambodia.

## 🙏 Appreciation

I came across a beautifully designed **Phnom Penh metro map** created by someone using [metromapmaker.com](https://metromapmaker.com), and I was truly inspired by their creativity and vision.

I deeply admire the effort and imagination that went into visualizing a metro system for our city — it resonated with me as both a Phnom Penh native and a software developer.

> If you are the creator of this map or know who made it, I’d love to connect and say thank you personally.  
> Your work added a meaningful spark to this project, and I hope to build something that honors the spirit of your vision.
