# ðŸš‡ Metro-System-PhnomPenh

This is an imaginary project that I hope to bring to life one day.

After visiting cities like Bangkok, New York, and Atlantaâ€”where metro systems saved me a lot of time and money as a broke college studentâ€”I was inspired to imagine a similar system for Phnom Penh.

Even though Phnom Penh doesnâ€™t have a metro system yet, I love the city deeply and wanted to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in software development to build something visionary. This project combines my passion for urban transportation and backend development, and I hope it can one day help shape a better-connected future for Cambodia.
